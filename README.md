# SmartSolarService
A project for the codevelop/ team

## Building & running

  - You need to run Visual Studio as administrator, so it can setup IIS to host the service.
  (Either that, or reconfigure the service to use IIS Express)
  
  - If you get error 9009 trying to run lessc - you will need to nstall lessc. 
This is probably (AC confirm?) easiest done by installing NPM, then: npm install -g lessc
